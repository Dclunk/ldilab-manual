# Reproducible practices

At the Lab, we evaluate researchers' adherence to reproducible practices, and their ability to produce a publishable and **reproducible** package encapsulating their work. Many researchers are challenged with this. The Lab, to be credible, and for clarity of our findings, also needs to work with **reproducible** practices. You will be challenged by this.

## Some additional recommended readings and presentations

These are primarily directed at authors and researchers, but you should be aware of what is feasible and practicable, since often, you will be in the role of recommending such practices to authors in order to fix problems you identified.
