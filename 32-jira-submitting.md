:::{tip}
Reminder: for the AEA, the JMS is ScholarOne.
:::

## Submitting to JMS

1. Open the issue on JIRA. It must be `Approved`.
2. Click on the `Submit to MC` transition. A pop-up will be shown.

3. In the pop-up, you should have all the necessary information
   - Note: links in the pop-up window are not clickable: double-click, then use right-click to `Open in New Tab`
   - `MCEntryURL`  has the link to Manuscript Central (MC) in order to submit
   - `Manuscript Central Identifier` to find the manuscript
   - Field [`MCRecommendationV2`] has the information about how the editorial office should proceed, to be selected in the JMS
      - In cases where `MCStatus` contains `RR`, the information will be in field [`MCRecommendation`]
   - Field [`Git working location`] has the information to clone the repository (and thus be able to access the report)
4. If necessary, clone the Bitbucket repository associated with the issue. You should find a `REPLICATION.pdf` there.

:::{admonition} If there is no `REPLICATION.pdf`...
... then the Approver probably forgot to create it. Contact the Approver to avoid any misunderstandings.
