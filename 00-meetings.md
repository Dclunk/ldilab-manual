The team meets twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. 

:::{note}

All times are Eastern time zone.

## Monday meetings

:::{admonition} Regular Monday meetings are "all-hands-on-deck" meetings. 
:class: tip

**5:30 PM - 6:30 PM** on Zoom.

:::

Team members will have received a calendar invite with the Zoom link.

All team members are expected to attend, any absence should be motivated by email, with a status report on cases being worked on.

## Thursday meetings

:::{admonition}  Thursday meetings are "check-in" meetings.
:class: tip

Meetings happen in two time blocks:

- 8:00 AM - 8:30 AM (Green)
- 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM (Blue)

:::

:::{note}


Participation is by "call-in" (video not required) using Zoom. 
Team members give a very brief update, signal any issues, and sign off. The typical status report is less than 1 minute.
