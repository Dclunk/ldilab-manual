# Mathematica-related procedures

In this section, we will show you a few things related specifically to running code reproducibly with Wolfram Mathematica. For more general debugging tips for this and other computer languages, see [our wiki](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/).

## Files

Mathematica uses the file extension `.nb`. This includes both code and the output. You will run the code, and then save the output in two ways: `.nb` and as a PDF.

```{note}
At this time, Mathematica is only available on CCSS machines.
```

## Instructions

Follow these instructions for each file:

- Open each `.nb` file, and do the following:
  - `Cell` -> `Delete all output`
  - `Evaluation` -> `Evaluate Notebook`
  - `Save`
  - `Save as...` -> `PDF` 
- Then **completely** exit Mathematica again!


::::{note}

You can paste this into the `Replication Steps` section when appropriate:

```
- Opened each `.nb` file, and did the following:
  - `Cell` -> `Delete all output`
  - `Evaluation` -> `Evaluate Notebook`
  - `Save`
  - `Save as...` -> `PDF` 
```
::::

Then commit both the re-executed notebooks and the new PDF files to your repository.

## Variations

There are a lot of different ways to run Mathematica code. Should this not work, talk to your supervisor.
