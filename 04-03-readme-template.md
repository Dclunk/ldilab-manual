# The README template

Researchers are encouraged (sometimes required) to adhere to a particular documentation standard. We have found that providing a template is useful to allow for complete coverage of all the topics a researcher should address in their README, which describers what to do with their package. The typical replication package needs information on data (provided or not), code (how to run it, and what is required), and the computational infrastructure necessary to be able to run the code.
